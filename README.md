# Sentiment-Classification-on-Amazon-Reivews

In this project , I did the following things:

Analyzed the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset, which contains 568,454 food reviews.

Preprocessed the review text by stemming, removing punctuations and stopwords, and created a weighted matrix using count matrix and TFIDF method in Python. Clustered sentiment based on customer rating socre.

Build a classification model for customers’ sentiment using naïve bayes, logistic regression and random forest in Python. Determined the accuracy with the largest AUC equaling to 0.88.

Visualized the keywords of positive and negative sentiment by drafting word clouds in R.
